# Monsoon Icon Extension
WARNING: THIS IS A HELPER EXTENSION USED TO HAVE EXTRA SVGS SYNC UP WITH MATERIAL ICON. THIS EXTENSION ALONE DOES NOTHING!!! THIS EXTENSION IS USED TO PROVIDE CUSTOM LOCATION PATH FOR THE CUSTOMIZABLE FEATURE PROVIDED BY MATERIAL ICON


The "monsoon-icon" extension for Visual Studio Code serves as a storage location for extra icons that can be accessed by other extensions, such as the popular "Material Icon Theme" extension. It is designed to facilitate the synchronization of icons across all instances of Visual Studio Code in any environment.

## Purpose

Visual Studio Code extensions like "Material Icon Theme" provide a set of icons for various file types and folders. However, there might be cases where users need additional icons or want to customize existing ones. The "monsoon-icon" extension allows users to store these extra icons conveniently and ensures that they are synchronized across all instances of Visual Studio Code.

## How it Works

The "monsoon-icon" extension does not provide any functionality or user interface within Visual Studio Code. Instead, it serves as a placeholder for extra icons that can be accessed by other extensions. Users can place custom SVG icons or icon packs in the storage location provided by this extension, and other extensions can then reference these icons as needed.

## Installation

You can install the "monsoon-icon" extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon in the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "monsoon-icon".
4. Click on the "Install" button.
